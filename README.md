# PaintingAuthentication
AI-powered web application for determining whether a painting is the original or a fake.

Main workflow:
<img width="960" alt="image" src="https://github.com/Matt757/PaintingAuthentication/assets/61180595/dd497802-b694-4dc2-b78a-a566de1437a5">


Select a painting which will be displayed on the left side. Then click the Check Painting button. The image will be tested using the AI. During the testing phase, there is an option to provide feedback to the AI if it makes a correct assessment.

For now, this is a mock-up interface with a predetermined answer.
